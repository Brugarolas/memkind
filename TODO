Backlog
=======

Testing
-------
    * Test with more BIOS configurations.

    * Need to test GB pages on a range of kernel versions.

    * More robust tests for out of memory and spill over conditions.

    * Need to more carefully split out tests based on requirements,
      and run those cases supported by the system.  Examples include
      kernel version greater than 3.11, sufficient 2 MB pages in
      hugetlbfs, and support for 1 GB pages.

    * Need to expand performance testing significantly.

Documentation
-------------
    * Document the memkind_ops structure in a man page.

    * Better documentation for how NULL pointers in ops structure are
      handled.

    * Provide an architectural overview document.

Features
--------
    * Add gcc malloc hooks for hbwmalloc interface.
      http://www.gnu.org/software/libc/manual/html_node/Hooks-for-Malloc.html

    * Consider redefining the meaning of memkind_free(0, ptr) so that
      it is calls memkind_get_kind_for_free() internally.

    * Extend huge page support using libhugetlbfs.

    * Support for non-standard x86 page sizes like 128 MB.

    * Implement the use of thread local storage for arena index.  If a
      thread is pinned, then this can be used to avoid calling
      sched_getcpu() more than once.  It would also benefit cases
      where thread location is unimportant, and the arena index can
      be derived from a hash of the thread ID.

    * Add support in jemalloc and memkind for modifying the file
      descriptor and offset values passed to mmap() to enable file
      backed memory allocations.

    * Consider overriding the je_chunk_alloc_mmap() routine rather
      than modifying it. This would be the the entry point for a
      single memkind callback.

    * Support for verbose mode by setting environment variable which
      will log debug diagnostic information.

    * Use atexit() rather than __attribute__((destructor)) to support
      compilers other than gcc.

Issues
------
    * Error message when starting memkind service after it is already
      started is very cryptic.

    * The supporting jemalloc library is a fork of version 3.5.1.
      Need to rebase changes for supporting memkind to the head of
      jeamlloc's dev branch.  Since version 3.6.0 uses arenas for huge
      allocations, this will simplify the modifications required to
      enable memkind.
