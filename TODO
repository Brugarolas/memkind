Backlog
=======

Testing
-------
    * Major gaps in code coverage exist in memkind_pmtt.c and the bind
    mode for the hbw interface.

    * Currently testing on simics with KNL BIOS configured for flat
    mode all-to-all.  Need to test with all other supported BIOS
    configurations.

    * Need to test GB pages on a range of kernel versions.

    * More robust tests for out of memory and spill over conditions.

    * Need fast running unit tests that have no external requirements
    and provide decent code coverage.

    * Need to expand performance testing significantly.

Documentation
-------------
    * Complete all man pages.

    * Better documentation for how NULL pointers in obs structure are
    handled.

    * Provide an architectural overview document.

Features
--------
    * Support for non-standard x86 page sizes like 128 MB (request
    from Cray).

    * Use autotools for configure and make.

    * Support for verbose mode by setting environment variable which
    will log debug diagnostic information.

    * Use atexit() rather than __attribute__((destructor)) to support
    compilers other than gcc.

Issues
------
    * ifort's FASTMEM mark up does not work.

    * Error message when starting memkind service when it is already
    started is very cryptic.
