Backlog
=======

Testing
-------
    * Major gaps in code coverage exist in memkind_pmtt.c and the bind
      mode for the hbw interface.

    * Test with more BIOS configurations.

    * Need to test GB pages on a range of kernel versions.

    * More robust tests for out of memory and spill over conditions.

    * Need fast running unit tests that have no external requirements
      and provide decent code coverage.

    * Need to expand performance testing significantly.

Documentation
-------------
    * Complete gbtlb man page.

    * Document the memkind_ops structure in a man page.

    * Better documentation for how NULL pointers in ops structure are
      handled.

    * Provide an architectural overview document.

Features
--------
    * Support for non-standard x86 page sizes like 128 MB (request
      from Cray).

    * Support for verbose mode by setting environment variable which
      will log debug diagnostic information.

    * Add --enable-debug configure option.

    * Use atexit() rather than __attribute__((destructor)) to support
      compilers other than gcc.

Issues
------
    * Error message when starting memkind service when it is already
      started is very cryptic.

    * Calling hbw_realloc() on a vector that was originally allocated
      with gigabyte pages is not handled properly.
