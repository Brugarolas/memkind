The example directory contains some example codes that use the memkind
interface and a Makefile to build them.  The simplest is the
hello_example.c which is a hello world variant.  The filter_example.c
shows how you would use high bandwidth memory to store a reduction of
a larger data set stored in DDR.  The stream_example.c is a variant of
the McCalpin stream benchmark that parses a command line option that
specifies which memkind to use.  Pass --help to stream_memkind for the
available options.  There is also an example of how to create user
defined kinds.  This example creates kinds which isolate allocations
to a single NUMA node each backed by a single arena.

If memkind or jemalloc were installed to non-standard locations use
the MEMKIND_PREFIX and JEMALLOC_PREFIX variables to enable the
Makefile.  For example, if you configured jemalloc with
--prefix=$HOME/jemalloc and memkind with --prefix=$HOME/memkind, then
you can build the examples as follows:

make MEMKIND_PREFIX=$HOME/memkind JEMALLOC_PREFIX=$HOME/jemalloc
