The example directory contains some example codes that use the memkind
interface.  The simplest is the hello_example.c which is a hello world
variant.  The filter_example.c shows how you would use high bandwidth
memory to store a reduction of a larger data set stored in DDR.  The
stream_example.c is a variant of the McCalpin stream benchmark that
parses a command line option that specifies which memkind to use.
Pass --help to stream_memkind for the available options.  There is
also an example of how to create user defined kinds.  This example
creates kinds which isolate allocations to a single NUMA node each
backed by a single arena.
