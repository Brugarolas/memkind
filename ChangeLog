* Thu Nov 13 2014 Christopher Cantalupo <christopher.m.cantalupo@intel.com> v0.1.0
- Increased test code coverage significantly.
- Fixed bug in memkind_error_message() for MEMKIND_ERROR_TOOMANY.
- Removed memkind_arena_free() API since it was redundant with memkind_default_free().
- Static memkind structs are now declared as extern in the headers and defined in the
  source files files rather than being statically defined in the headers.
* Thu Oct 30 2014 Christopher Cantalupo <christopher.m.cantalupo@intel.com> v0.0.9
- Now building with autotools.
- Updated documentation.
- Fixed typo in copyright.
- Fixed test scripts to properly handle return code of each test.
- Added C++03 standard allocator that uses hbw_malloc and hbw_free.
* Tue Sep 30 2014 Christopher Cantalupo <christopher.m.cantalupo@intel.com> v0.0.8
- Added GBTLB functionality, code clean up, documentation updates,
  examples directory.  Examples includes stream modified to use
  memkind interface.  Code coverage still lacking, and documentation
  incomplete.
