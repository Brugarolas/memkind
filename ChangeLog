* Fri Jul 24 2015 Krzysztof Kulakowski <krzysztof.kulakowski@intel.com> v0.3.0
- Added two new kinds: MEMKIND_INTERLEAVE and MEMKIND_HBW_INTERLEAVE
  (for details please take a look at man/memkind.3).
- Added memkind_allocated example which demonstrates usage of memkind 
  with alignas() alignment specifier introduced in C++11 
  (for details please take a look at examples/README). 
- Added autohbw example which demonstrates how application can use memkind
  without modyfing existing codebase (for details please 
  take a look at examples/autohbw_README).
- jemalloc is now internal part of memkind RPM instead of dependency.
- Added support for using thread local storage to improve performance in
  multithreaded applications (enabled by configure time option: --enable-tls).
- Added posibility to set number of jemalloc arenas per kind by
  configure time parameter or enviromental variable
  (for details please take a look at MEMKIND_ARENA_NUM_PER_KIND section 
  of man/memkind.3).

* Fri Jan 9 2015 Christopher Cantalupo <christopher.m.cantalupo@intel.com> v0.2.0
- Bumped memkind ABI version to 0:1:0.
- Removed memkind_get_kind_for_free() from externally facing API's.  Instead if
  memkind_free() is called with zero passed for the kind then
  memkind_get_kind_for_free() is called internally.
- Moved to single callback memkind_partition_mmap() to simplify
  jemalloc modifications.
- Added hooks for setting file descriptor and offset for mmap enabling
  file-backed memory kinds.
- Added a void pointer called "priv" to memkind structure for storing data for
  user-defined kinds.
- Removed call to sched_getcpu(), now thread id is hashed to determine the arena
  index.
- Added weak symbol hooks for decorating the heap management functions.
- Fixed several issues with init.d/memkind script and spec file scriptlets that
  are exposed by SLES-12.
- Introduced an example library called numakind.
  The numakind library will allocate from the closest NUMA node to a thread as
  measured when that thread makes its first allocation call.
- Fixed error handling in memkind_gbtlb_mmap() that could cause a segfault when
  gigabyte pages are not available.
- Added tests for PMTT parser.
- Removed binary mock PMTT table from source code, replaced it with a hexdump.
- Fixed a number of issues in test scripts which were suppressing errors.
- Removed unnecessary includes from header files.
- Better error checking in example code.
- Documentation update and clean up.

* Thu Nov 13 2014 Christopher Cantalupo <christopher.m.cantalupo@intel.com> v0.1.0
- Increased test code coverage significantly.
- Fixed bug in memkind_error_message() for MEMKIND_ERROR_TOOMANY.
- Removed memkind_arena_free() API since it was redundant with memkind_default_free().
- Static memkind structs are now declared as extern in the headers and defined in the
  source files files rather than being statically defined in the headers.

* Thu Oct 30 2014 Christopher Cantalupo <christopher.m.cantalupo@intel.com> v0.0.9
- Now building with autotools.
- Updated documentation.
- Fixed typo in copyright.
- Fixed test scripts to properly handle return code of each test.
- Added C++03 standard allocator that uses hbw_malloc and hbw_free.
* Tue Sep 30 2014 Christopher Cantalupo <christopher.m.cantalupo@intel.com> v0.0.8
- Added GBTLB functionality, code clean up, documentation updates,
  examples directory.  Examples includes stream modified to use
  memkind interface.  Code coverage still lacking, and documentation
  incomplete.
